The [ED1](https://citilab.eu) is a Spanish ESP32-based educational board with a TFT display, LED matrix, capacitive touch buttons, and various sensors. This project provides [ESPHome](https://esphome.io) YAML configurations to integrate it with [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/).

## Built-in hardware

- **1.44" TFT display** (ST7735) -- shows device status, IP address, temperature
- **6 capacitive touch buttons** -- exposed as binary sensors
- **Light sensor** -- ambient light percentage
- **Buzzer** -- PWM audio output
- **IR receiver** (38 kHz) -- remote control support
- **WiFi signal and uptime sensors**
- **CPU temperature monitoring**
- **Bluetooth proxy** -- extends Home Assistant BLE range

## Expansion support

These peripherals connect to the board's expansion headers:

- **LED matrix** (WS2812) -- GPIO12 output for LED strips (e.g., 32x8 = 256 LEDs)
- **Stepper motors** (2x 28BYJ-48) -- via MCP23009 I/O expander and ULN2004A drivers

## Board revisions

The ED1 comes in two hardware revisions: Rev 1.0 and Rev 2.3. Core packages work on both revisions, but some peripherals differ between them. See the [hardware overview](/ed1-hoas/hardware/overview) for details.

## Next steps

Head to the [getting started](/ed1-hoas/getting-started) guide to flash your first configuration.
